# Aimarekin's Spicetify Extensions

This repository hosts the extensions I create for Spicetify. For now it's just playing-source.

Head to each extension's folder for more information.

The compiled typescript, and manually installable extensions are in the dist branch. The extensions can be installed through the Spicetify marketplace, but also [manually](https://spicetify.app/docs/advanced-usage/extensions#manual-install).
