# Aimarekin's Spicetify Extensions

This repository hosts the extensions I create for Spicetify. Head to each extension's folder for more information.

The compiled typescript, and manually installable extensions are in the [_dist](https://github.com/Aimarekin/Aimarekins-Spicetify-Extensions/tree/main/dist) folder. The extensions can be installed through the Spicetify marketplace, but also [manually](https://spicetify.app/docs/advanced-usage/extensions#manual-install).
