# Playing Source
 
See the context of where you're playing from, and jump to it.

On mobile devices, there is an indicator on top of the currently playing screen telling you where Spotify is playing audio from. For example, from a playlist, from your queue, or from an artist's top songs.

This extension seeks to implement this feature on desktop: hover your mouse over the cover art of the currently playing track to see a popup with information of the playing context.
